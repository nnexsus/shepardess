# Shepardess.net

Shepardess is a hub for weather, stormchasing, forecasting, and other information.

Update: 2025 (v1.2.0)

```diff
NEW:


CHANGES:
+ Updated desktop and mobile designs!
+ Featured streams will now appear yellow on both the main stream selector and drag & drop menu.

REMOVED:
- Removed live updates / chat panel. (Hard to upkeep)
- Removed warnings panel. (Working on new system)
- Removed separated featured stream panel.

```

NOTE:
This update is a precursor update to anything in 2025. I mainly wanted to rid myself of things like the live-chat panel
which ate up a decent amount of screen space, but was hardly used. Less features overall will bring more time and attention
to the existing ones, so further improvements to the map, stream UI, etc. are to be expected throughout the year!

The live-chat/update panel and warnings are still in the app, just no longer accessible. They may return in the future.
