# Shepardess.net

Shepardess is a hub for weather, stormchasing, forecasting, and other information.

Update: Eyewall (v1.1.0)

```diff
NEW:
+ Social panel rework! Now shows profiles of chasers, forecasters, etc. with links to everyones socials.
+ Chat panel rework! Rather than an inactive live chat, it is now a more active Live Updates, which will post photos, links, videos, and more for active weather events.
+ Past panel rework! The past panel will now aim to be more generalized in its coverage and provide more info on the day and weather itself rather than my personal outlook on it.
+ New Convective Outlook and Main Location Risk indicators in the top status panel!
+ Added tropical storm / hurricane cones, wind fields, and tracks as an optional layer on the map (with potentially more to come)!
+ Added Hurricane, Tropical Storm, Eyewall, and Hidden Gem markers to the map!

CHANGES:
+ Improved Polygons, Markers, and Warning Polygons in the map (in both appearance and usage).
+ Map panel controls are formatted and hidden better.
+ Improved and fixed issues with the tutorial when you first open the page.
+ Greatly improved the map rendering, no longer rerendering or making multiple requests for the same data.
+ Fixed issues with SPC warnings not appearing on the map or updating.
+ Added a few 'No/None' placeholders to the Warnings panel.
+ Changed the 'Center' map control option to center on user location instead of mine (was a weird feature before).
+ Fixed a VERY annoying issue where the map would not scale correctly on smaller screens and/or mobile, causing the bottom of the tiles, polygons, markers, etc. to be cut off.
+ Fixed multiple issues with the site design on smaller screens and mobile.
+ Rewrote backend for better access security and to move towards multi-user authentication.
+ General design or static text updates as well.
+ Probably more that I've forgotten over like... a month or something.

REMOVED:
- Removed ability to chat in Live Chat (it was virtually unused as I had kinda anticipated).
- Removed Search & Rescue and Forecasting indicators as they were pointless mostly.
- Removed a few selected indicators, texts, hints, etc. from smaller screen and mobile designs.
- Removed /control-panel setup for tablets. Was too outdated to update.
